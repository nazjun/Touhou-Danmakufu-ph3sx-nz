# Touhou Danmakufu ph3sx

A modified version of Touhou Danmakufu ph3 geared towards optimization and availability of more complex features.<br>
DnhViewer is not provided nor supported.

Not guaranteed to not randomly crash. Report crashes and bugs [in the "Issues" page](https://github.com/Natashi/Touhou-Danmakufu-ph3sx-2/issues), or [the ph3sx Discord server](https://discord.gg/f9KFujKGEx).<br>
Not fully backwards-compatible with vanilla ph3. Replays files, saved common data files, and .dat archives for vanilla ph3 can't be used for ph3sx, and vice versa.

Originally made to be used for Sapphire Panlogism and Treasure Castle Labyrinth.

## Notable Features:
- Much better performance overall.
- Numerous additions to the scripting language.
- New script functions and features.
- Complete overhaul of the .dat archive format, with better encryption and compression.
  - ***Can't be cracked with regular extractors!***

### Special Thanks:
- **WishMakers** - Mainly for providing a non-broken reference point with his Woo repository. Slightly-less-mainly for that one pull request I never acted upon.
- **Naudiz** - For subjecting me to a myriad of unspeakable acts of torture with his near-hourly bug reports and feature requests, and an emotional support dog/wolf/spyrogyra/whateverthefuckhisspeciesis.
